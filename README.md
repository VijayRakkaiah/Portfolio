# Vijay Rakkaiah — Portfolio

This repository contains a single-page portfolio site suitable for GitHub Pages.

## Folder layout
See `index.html`, `assets/css/styles.css`, `assets/js/main.js`, images in `assets/img/`, and the CV in `assets/docs/VIJAY_RAKKAIAH_CV.pdf`.

## How to use / deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (example name: `vijay-rakkaiah-portfolio`).
2. Copy the folder contents into the repo (push to `main` branch).
3. Make sure the folder structure is preserved:
   - `index.html` at root
   - `assets/` folder with `css/`, `js/`, `img/`, `docs/`
4. On GitHub, go to **Settings > Pages** (or **Site settings > Pages**), choose branch `main` and folder `/ (root)` then Save.
5. After a minute, your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` or for a user/organization repo `https://<your-username>.github.io/`.

## Notes & next steps
- Replace placeholder project links (`#`) with your real GitHub repo links or live notebooks.
- Add LinkedIn & GitHub profile URLs in the Contact section.
- Optionally add analytics, custom domain, or a contact form backend (e.g., Formspree) if you want email to be received without opening mail client.
